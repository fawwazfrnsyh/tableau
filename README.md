What is your strategy to improve revenue? Please give some evidence to support your answer!

To increase revenue for the coffee shop based on the provided data, there are a few potential strategies that could be implemented.
- Since females make more transactions than males, the coffee shop could consider offering deals and reward programs specifically targeted towards women to encourage more frequent visits and larger purchases.
- As the age group above 50 makes the highest number of transactions, creating advertisements and menu items that appeal to this demographic could be a valuable strategy.
- Since beverages are more popular than food, particularly coffee and tea, the coffee shop could focus on making high-quality coffee and tea offerings, and expanding the beverage menu with new and unique options. This could include seasonal drinks, specialty blends, or unique flavors. To further increase revenue, the coffee shop could also consider selling food items that complement the coffee and tea offerings, such as pastries or sandwiches, to encourage customers to spend more during their visits.
